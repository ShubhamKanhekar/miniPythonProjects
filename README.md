# miniPythonProjects

This repository contains some of the projects and programs that are small and cannot be given its own repositories.
These programs/jupyter_notebooks were created by me (Shubham Kanhekar) in an effort to learn and understand the language through practice and implementations.
Although these 'miniProjects' are not very imporessive in nature, these are made from scratch and helped me understand the intricacies of the popular programing language.<br>
